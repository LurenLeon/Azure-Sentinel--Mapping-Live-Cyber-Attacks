## Introduction
<!-- Provide a detailed introduction to your project, its purpose, and what users can expect to achieve with it -->

This lab provides a hands-on experience for tracking live cyber attacks using Azure Sentinel and mapping them for analysis.

As an overview, this lab will involve a honeypot exposed to the internet, collecting attack log data, and a map to display the number of attacks from their respective countries. I have also used Windows PowerShell ISE, a third part API which is ipgeolocation, and Azure for setting up the honeypot VM and capturing log data.

We will use a PowerShell Script that will take the IP addresses from attempted failed logins and insert them onto ipgeolocation. These logs will be used to create a query in Sentinel to map the geographic locations.


## Prerequisites
<!-- List any prerequisites or dependencies that users need to have before using your lab -->
Before you begin, ensure you have:

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- An active Azure subscription.
- Azure Sentinel workspace set up.
- Permissions to create and manage resources in Azure.
- Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) access.
- An account on [IPGeolocation.io](https://ipgeolocation.io/) for the API Key.
- Custom PowerShell Script (Provided by Josh Madakor).


<h2>Step 1: Creating your account on Azure </h2>
Create an Azure free account, insert credit card information and receive $200 free credits. 

## Step 2: Create a Honeypot Virtual Machine

On the search bar, search for Virtual Machines, click create virtual machine.

| Selected Inbound Ports   | RDP (3389)          |


Leave Disks section as default

On the networking section, find NIC network security group, change to advanced 
Create network security group- Delete original inbound rule, add an inbound rule

### Firewall Rule Configuration - DANGER_ANY_IN

| Configuration             | Value           |
|---------------------------|-----------------|
| Source                    | Any             |

| Name                      | DANGER_ANY_IN   |


## Step 3: Create a Log Analytics Workspace 

Search for Log Analytics Workspace on Azure, create Log Analytics Workspace

Copy the following when creating:
- **Subscription:** Pay as you go
- **Resource group:** Choose the `honeypotlab`
- **Name:** LAWhoneypot
- **Region:** West US 2



## Step 4: Configure Microsoft Defender for Cloud

Follow these steps to configure Microsoft Defender for Cloud on Azure:

- Search for Microsoft Defender for the Cloud on Azure.
- On the left side bar, navigate to the management section and click on "Environment Settings."
- Click on the environment named "LAWhoneypot."
- Turn off SQL Servers on Machines, and then click save.
- Click on Data collection, choose "All Events," and click save.





Return to Log Analytics workspace
Find virtual machine section, and click "Connect" to connect the workspace to the honeypotvm


-Setup Microsoft Sentinel- Find and click create
-Click Log Analytics workspace that was created- Add
