## Introduction
<!-- Provide a detailed introduction to your project, its purpose, and what users can expect to achieve with it -->

This lab provides a hands-on experience for tracking live cyber attacks using Azure Sentinel and mapping them for analysis.

As an overview, this lab will involve a honeypot exposed to the internet, collecting attack log data, and a map to display the number of attacks from their respective countries. I have also used Windows PowerShell ISE, a third part API which is ipgeolocation, and Azure for setting up the honeypot VM and capturing log data.

We will use a PowerShell Script that will take the IP addresses from attempted failed logins and insert them onto ipgeolocation. These logs will be used to create a query in Sentinel to map the geographic locations.

<!-- List any prerequisites or dependencies that users need to have before using your lab -->
Before you begin, ensure you have:

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- An active Azure subscription.
- Azure Sentinel workspace set up.
- Permissions to create and manage resources in Azure.
- Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) access.
- An account on [IPGeolocation.io](https://ipgeolocation.io/) for the API Key.
- Custom PowerShell Script (Provided by Josh Madakor).


<h2>Step 1: Creating your account on Azure </h2>
Create an Azure free account, insert credit card information and receive $200 free credits. 

## Step 2: Create a Honeypot Virtual Machine

On the search bar, search for Virtual Machines, click create virtual machine.

### Azure Sentinel Honeypot Lab Configuration

| Configuration           | Value               |
|--------------------------|---------------------|
| Subscription group       | Pay as you go       |
| Resource group           | Honeypotlab         |
| Virtual machine name     | Honeypot-vm         |
| Region                   | West US 3           |
| Security Type            | Standard            |
| Image                    | Windows 10 Pro      |
| Size                     | Standard            |
| Username and Password    | Create your own     |
| Public Inbound Ports     | Allow selected ports|
| Selected Inbound Ports   | RDP (3389)          |


Leave Disks section as default

On the networking section, find NIC network security group, change to advanced 
Create network security group- Delete original inbound rule, add an inbound rule

### Firewall Rule Configuration - DANGER_ANY_IN

| Configuration             | Value           |
|---------------------------|-----------------|
| Source                    | Any             |
| Source Port Ranges        | *               |
| Destination               | Any             |
| Service                   | Custom          |
| Destination Port Ranges   | *               |
| Protocol                  | Any             |
| Action                    | Allow           |
| Priority                  | 100             |
| Name                      | DANGER_ANY_IN   |


## Step 3: Create a Log Analytics Workspace 

Search for Log Analytics Workspace on Azure, create Log Analytics Workspace

Copy the following when creating:
- **Subscription:** Pay as you go
- **Resource group:** Choose the `honeypotlab`
- **Name:** law-honeypot1 
- **Region:** West US 2

| Configuration      | Value               |
| ------------------- | ------------------- |
| Subscription        | Azure Subscription 1|
| Resource Group      | Honeypotlab         |
| Name                | law-honeypot1       |
| Region              | West US 2           |



## Step 4: Configure Microsoft Defender for Cloud

Follow these steps to configure Microsoft Defender for Cloud on Azure:

- Search for Microsoft Defender for the Cloud on Azure.
- On the left side bar, navigate to the management section and click on "Environment Settings."
- Click on the environment named "law-honeypot1."

# On Defender Plans: 
- Turn off SQL Servers on Machines, and then click save.
- Turn on Servers, click save.
- On the right hand bar, click on Data collection, choose "All Events," and click save.


## Step 5: Return to Log Analytics Workspace
- Search for "Log Analytics Workspaces"
- Select log-honeypot
- On the right hand bar, under Workspace Data Sources, click "Virtual Machines"
- Select the workspace name honeypot-vm
- Click "Connect" to connect to the workspace to the honeypotvm


## Step 6: Configure Microsoft Sentinel
- Search for "Microsoft Sentinel"
- Click "Create Microsoft Sentinel"
- Select honeypot-log
- Click add

## Step 7: Log into the VM via Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and Disable Firewall
We want to make the VM accessible and exposed to the internet so we can easily collect attack data.
- Go to Virtual Machines on Azure, find the honeypot-vm
- Click on honeypot-vm and copy the IP address
- Log into the VM with Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) with your credentials made for the vm. You can find RDP on your Windows machine by searching for Remote Desktop Protocol. *Refer back to step 2 for credentials*
- Once logged in, accept the certificate warning
- Select NO for all chosen privacy settings on your device
- On your VM search for "wf.msc" (Windows Defender Firewall)
- Click "Windows Defender Firewall Properties"
- Turn Firewall State OFF (For all profiles- Domain, Private, Public)
- Hit Apply and Ok

# Step 8: To test that the firewall is off:
- Ping the VM with: ping -t <VM IP>
